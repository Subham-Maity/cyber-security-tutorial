##### Discuss the roll of Cloud Computing in Cyber Security ?
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Cloud computing and cyber security are the two advanced sectors in IT world making huge changes of working pattern in the
  field. When these two merge it opens a wide range of possibilities. The cloud computing security provides companies with the
  availability, reliability, and security they need to conduct business in a global marketplace. Advanced cyber security features
  combine with physical infrastructure to create a comprehensive, secure solution to your cloud computing needs.

  As companies migrate more and more of their data and infrastructure to the cloud, the question of cloud computing security
  becomes paramount. Cloud security provides multiple levels of control in a network infrastructure to afford continuity and
  protection. It's an essential ingredient in creating an environment that works for companies around the world. The benefits of
  cloud computing can be affordably attained by partnering with advanced private cloud computing providers- in a way that doesn't
  jeopardize your company's security.

  At a time when cyber attacks are growing worldwide, and high-profile cybercrime such as data theft, ransomware and computer
  hacks have become the order of the day, experts believe that cloud computing may provide the security against cyber threats that
  companies need. They reason that Cloud helps security operations respond quicker to threats and focus on business risk as
  opposed to spending countless hours researching threats and trouble-shooting aging on-premises systems. It also saves a
  substantial cost for organizations in the long run.

##### Write down the basic safety and security tips to prevent cybercafe from cyber threats ?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Computers at public places such as internet cafe's can be a great place for hackers to glean sensitive information when we use the
  internet.
  Here we suggest a few safety tips / countermeasures that will reduce the risk of getting hacked. For one-stop-shop protection
  seriously consider purchasing a IronKey USB device. This should keep machines safe and offer more protection than the
  countermeasures produced below. The IronKey in addition to providing an effective countermeasure to the exploits discussed
  above, also provides password protected hardware encryption that facilitate the secure storage of sensitive data. The IronKey
  has won numerous awards amongst the security community and is widely trusted and used by US. government agencies and
  fortune 500 companies. The countermeasures without the use of an IronKey are:
  - Shoulder Surfers - Nothing technical here, just good observation I awareness skills. Need to be aware of the people around when
  typing in login details of any sort if there are people in the cyber cafe watching others, cover the keyboard when logging in.

  - **Phishing Scams** - Use more up-to-date versions of a browser when using the internet ia a cyber cafe as they have anti-Phishing
  measures built into them. How do we run a modern browser when the version installed in the internet cafe is old? The options are
  to download and install it (which may not be possible due to restrictions), however a better way is to use portable apps
  (www.portableapps.com) and prepare a USB Flash Drive with the latest version of firefox. This will give the option to "carry the
  application with you" and use it on any Windows machine. Also all browsing history will be stored on your USB Flash Drive and
  leave no remnants on the computer. However be aware that any digital certificates are stored on the computer and will need to
  be deleted A little education on how to identify a phishing site is the best form of protection, take a short quiz to see if you can
  recognise phishing websites and see if you can tell between a genuine site and a phishing site. After the quiz you will be well
  aware of how to spot a phishing site and ensure safety of online identity.

  - **Network Sniffer** - Most popular sites are secure as they protect credentials (user id and password) by encrypting them. However
  you should be mindful about the typical surfing
  habits performed in cyber cafe's. The messages on Email and Instant Messaging are not secure by default. Messages sent and
  received are not encrypted and can be captured by the Network Sniffer, if installed on the internet cafe computer. Do not send
  emails or messages by instant messenger which contain sensitive information. If we need to send a sensitive message, consider
  using a browser which utilises the "Tor anonymity network" (a technology to maintains anonymity). The Tor project are now
  offering a portable browse built upon firefox. This offering is known as the Tor Browser Bundle and can be downloaded from the
  link previous. The Tor Bundle is a free which can be run off a USB flash memory. The Tor network is rather slow, however it will
  ensure your session is encrypted and the Sniffer in the cyber cafe rendered useless. Be aware that there are Tor Browser Bundle
  has limitations such as flash video and javascript are disabled and do not work. This may result in certain websites not functioning.
  So it may be better to fire up Tor Browser Bundle when you need to send something sensitive or keep your anonymity in the
  internet cafe. On-line Banking on the other hand is quite secure as your session is normally encrypted (provided the machine has
  not been compromised (e.g., modified hosts file) to redirect the online banking requests to a phishing site)or your credentials
  stolen by a keylogger trojan.

  - **Key loggers:**
  There are various approaches that can take to protect against keyloggers. There are suggestions on other websites that using
  virtual keyboards or cut and paste methods can bypass the keyloggers. The author has tested a few virtual keyboards that are
  marketed as offering protection against keyloggers, however the the keystrokes have been captured. Virtual keyboards certainly
  offer protection to hardware keyloggers, however sophisticated software keyloggers, sometimes installed as spyware / trojans
  can capture input from 'cut and paste' and virtual keyboard keypresses.

##### What is Cyber Security ? Define Torjan , Virus , Worm , Spam
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  - **Cyber Security** is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data,
  as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
  The field is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network
  standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the
  various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology,
  cyber security is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.
  - **A Trojan** horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by
  cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering
  into loading and executing Trojans on their systems.
  - **Virus:** A computer virus is a type of malicious software that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer
  programs and inserting its own code. When this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a
  computer virus.
  - **Worm:** A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers.
  Often, it uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it.
  - **Spam:** Spamming is the use of messaging systems to send an unsolicited message, especially advertising, as well as sending
  messages repeatedly on the same site.

##### Discuss the Cyber Security laws and regulations in USA 2022
<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  **Cyber security laws**
  The federal government has established these new and revised cyber security laws recently to reinforce its policy in this area. As
  an example, here are a few: As a society, we need to educate ourselves on the hazards of cybercrime and how to protect ourselves
  from it. Another purpose is to encourage the sharing of information regarding cyber security dangers and other challenges.

  Data exchanges between businesses and the government may occur acceptably. In July 2014, the measure had already passed the
  Senate and was signed into law when initially introduced. The Cyber security Enhancement Act was signed into law by President
  Obama on December 18, 2014. Businesses and governments are working together to enhance cyber security education and
  research for the general population.

  Exchanges must notify customers immediately after a data breach but no later than 60 days after the incident. The Cyber security
  Act of 2015 It's the last act! Congress enacted an amendment to the NCCIC non-federal representation legislation on
  January 1, 2015.

  States have enacted rules to raise public awareness of the hazards connected with enterprises without proper security processes.
  Golden State citizens may rest easy knowing that their personal information is protected under the Personal Information
  Protection Act of 2003. In the event of a breach of cyber security regulations, businesses have the option to implement their
  security measures. This proposal suggests that a company's reputation and financial losses may be prevented if it invests in
  cyber security measures.

  Success in California has set a precedent that has motivated other states to follow. Legislation for Financial Services in New York
  City regarding cyber security Threats to an IT infrastructure may come from various sources. There is a more significant risk to
  data and financial systems than ever before posed by national governments, terrorist groups, as well as individual criminals,
  according to the DFS. Recently, scammers have been scouring the web for technological flaws to steal personal information
  stored online.

  Criminals who get access to sensitive information on New Yorkers and companies alike might face life-altering repercussions.
  Enough legislation is required to keep cyber security systems up to date. This law protects both IT firms and their consumer's
  private information. To satisfy this standard, an evaluation of the company's risks and a detailed risk management strategy
  are required. When New York's new Cyber Security law went into force on March 1, 2017

  Annual certification of compliance to the New York State Department of Financial Services has been completed for this calendar
  year. The last chapter has been completed, and the story is ended for good. Federal authorities have implemented several
  measures in response to current cyber threats to help companies better secure their data. Despite the government's best
  efforts, the administration's networks continue to be hacked.Same holds for private companies. Businesses should
  place a high focus on protecting their most important data and applications. Daily, cyber-thieves attacks get more complex. The
  ideal strategy for any company is to prevent issues from arising in the first place.

  HIPAA, Gramm-Leach-BIiIey Act, and the Homeland Security Act are the three most crucial federal cyber security laws in effect
  today. These three requirements necessitate that healthcare, financial, and government entities ensure the security of their
  systems and data. In any case, It's hard to predict whether an acceptable level of protection would be successful. The Federal
  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) mandates that all federal agencies implement information security policies,
  concepts, and standards. This list excludes Internet service providers and software developers. Standards use of vague
  language makes this more challenging.

##### What is the cyber world?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
  The concept of cyber space was firstly used in the novel called as "Neuromancer", which was written in 1984 by William Gibson.
  In the book, it is described that Case, who was characterized as a thief, connected to the systems of large employers in cyberspace
  by using a jack (Gibson, 2016). As a result of the developments in the internet and informatics world, the usage purposes of the
  computer and technologies of the society have diversified and the usage rate has increased. The virtual world, which has been
  formed in line with the opportunities that are offered by the internet and technological developments, is called cyber space. The
  concept of cyber space is also known as "cyber zone" or "cyber world".
  Cyber space is defined, in the national strategy document, as "the digital environment consisting of information systems that have
  spread all over the world, and of space and networks that connect them, or of independent information systems" Therefore,
  through the concept of cyber space, the non-real (virtual reality) environment with the help of the communication, which is
  established, via the internet, is defined. The internet is often referred to in the concept of cyber space, but the concept also
  includes telephone, telex, radio and television, which can be used with a remote control, apart from the internet, and sound and
  images, films, photographs, graphics and books that can be recorded.

##### What is internet and online resources?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  **Internet:** The Internet, sometimes called simply "the Net," is a worldwide system of computer networks - a network of networks
  in which users at any one computer can, if they have permission, get information from any other computer (and sometimes talk
  directly to users at other computers).

  **Benefits of the Internet:**
  - 1. Access to endless information, knowledge, and education.
  - 2. An increased ability to communicate, connect and share.
  - 3. The ability to work from home, collaborate and access a global workforce.
  - 4. Online resources: In general, web pages and documents on the internet that provide useful information are known as
  online resources. While an online resource is archetypal data and educational in nature, support software available online
  can also be considered a resource.

  **Types of online resources:**
  There are many different types of online resources, some of them are appropriate for research and some are not. It really
  depends on the type of content you are looking for. Here are a few that you may find useful for research:
  - 1. Current information such as stock quotes, sports scores, weather, and news
  - 2. Books and journal articles can take a long time to publish. For current information and news, the web can't be beaten.
  Examples: CNN, ESPN, NYSE
  - 3. Information on colleges, museums, government agencies or non-profit organizations
  - 4. If you're doing research on a specific company or institution, you can find a lot of information directly at the source.
  Examples: Department of Environmental Conservation, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Network for Good
  - 5. Online job postings, shopping, auctions, or travel services
  - 6. While these sources may not be used in research often, they're still the best at the type of content they offer. Examples:
  eBay, Etsy, Orbitz
  - 7. Library databases, scholarly journals, and eBooks
  - 8. These types of scholarly sources can be found by starting at the RIT library website. Examples: Ebook Central via ProQuest,
  ARTstor, Journal of Applied Economics

##### Explain the data security consideration?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  **Data security** is the protection of programs and data in computers and communication systems against unauthorized access,
  modification, destruction, disclosure or transfer whether accidental or intentional by building physical arrangements and
  software checks. It refers to the right of individuals or organizations to deny or restrict the collection and use of information
  about unauthorized access. Data security requires system managers to reduce unauthorized access to the systems by building
  physical arrangements and software checks.

  **Data security uses various methods to make sure that the data is correct, original, kept confidentially, and safe. It includes-**

  - 1. Ensuring the integrity of data.
  - 2. Ensuring the privacy of the data.
  - 3. Prevent the loss or destruction of data.
  - 4. Data security consideration involves the protection of data against unauthorized access, modification, destruction, loss,
  disclosure, or transfer whether accidental or intentional.

</details>


##### What is the meaning of security of information? What is information security example?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Information Security is not only about securing information from unauthorized access. Information Security is basically the
  practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording, or destruction of
  information. Information can be physical or electronic. Information can be anything like Your details or we can say your profile on
  social media, your data on your mobile phone, your biometrics, etc. Thus, Information Security spans so many research areas like
  Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics, online social media, etc.
  During First World War, Multi-tier Classification System was developed keeping in mind the sensitivity of the information. With
  the beginning of the Second World War formal alignment of the Classification System was done. Alan Turing was the one who
  successfully decrypted Enigma Machine which was used by Germans to encrypt warfare data.

  **Information security example,**

       - Passwords, network and host-based firewalls, network intrusion detection systems, access control lists, and data
  encryption are examples of logical controls.

##### What are the 3 principles of information security?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  When we discuss data and information, we must consider the CIA triad. The CIA triad refers to an information security model
  made up of three main components: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each component represents a fundamental
  objective of information security.

  **The three components of the CIA triad are discussed below:**

  - **1. Confidentiality:** This component is often associated with secrecy and the use of encryption. Confidentiality in this context
  means that the data is only available to authorized parties. When information has been kept confidential it means that it
  has not been compromised by other parties; confidential data are not disclosed to people who do not require them or who
  should not have access to them. Ensuring confidentiality means that information is organized in terms of who needs to have
  access, as well as the sensitivity of the data. A breach of confidentiality may take place through different means, for
  instance, hacking or social engineering.
  - **2. Integrity:** Data integrity refers to the certainty that the data is not tampered with or degraded during or after submission.
  It is the certainty that the data has not been subject to unauthorized modification, either intentional or unintentional.
  There are two points during the transmission process during which the integrity could be compromised: during the upload
  or transmission of data or during the storage of the document in the database or collection.
  - **3. Availability:** This means that the information is available to authorized users when it is needed. For a system to
  demonstrate availability, it must have properly functioning computing systems, security controls, and communication
  channels. Systems defined as critical (power generation, medical equipment, safety systems) often have extreme
  requirements related to availability. These systems must be resilient against cyber threats and have safeguards against
  power outages, hardware failures, and other events that might impact the system's availability.

##### What is the importance of information security? Explain the threats to Information Security?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  Information security, sometimes shortened to InfoSec, is the practice of protecting information by mitigating information risks. It
  is part of information risk management.

  **The Importance of Information Security **

  1. Every organization needs protection against cyber-attacks and security threats.
  2. Cybercrime and malware are constant threats to anyone with an Internet presence, and data breaches are time-consuming
  and expensive.
  3. The services of a trustworthy information security provider will mitigate digital information risks and keep systems running
  without disruption.
  4. Not all organizations require the same kind or degree of data protection. You have to choose a provider that you can work
  with from day to day, one that will meet your business's needs.
  5. A solid relationship with a security services provider gives your organization greater productivity, fewer disruptions, and a
  better reputation.

  **Threats to Information Security**


  1. Information Security threats can be many like Software attacks, theft of intellectual property, identity theft, theft of
  equipment or information, sabotage, and information extortion.
  2. The threat can be anything that can take advantage of a vulnerability to breach security and negatively alter, erase, or harm
  objects or objects of interest.
  3. Software attacks mean attacks by Viruses, Worms, Trojan Horses, etc. Many users believe that malware, virus, worms, and
  bots are all same things. But they are not the same, the only similarity is that they all are malicious software that behaves
  differently.
  4. Malware is a combination of 2 terms- Malicious and Software. So, Malware basically means malicious software that can be
  an intrusive program code or anything that is designed to perform malicious operations on the system.

##### What is meant by digital signature?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  A digital signature is a mathematical technique which validates the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital
  documents. It allows us to verify the author's name, date and time of signatures, and authenticate the message contents. The
  digital signature offers far more inherent security and intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation
  (Intentionally copy another person's characteristics) in digital communications.
  The computer-based business information authentication interrelates both technology and the law. It also calls for cooperation
  between the people of different professional backgrounds and areas of expertise. The digital signatures are different from other
  electronic signatures not only in terms of process and result, but also it makes digital signatures more serviceable for legal
  purposes. Some electronic signatures that legally recognizable as signatures may not be secure as digital signatures and may lead
  to uncertainty and disputes.
</details>


##### Mention some applications of Digital Signature?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  **The important reason to implement digital signatures in communication is:**

  - Authentication
  - Non-repudiation
  - Integrity

  **1. Authentication:** Authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a user who wants to access the system. In the
  digital signature, authentication helps to authenticate the sources of messages.

  **2. Non-repudiation:** non-repudiation means an assurance of something that cannot be denied. It ensures that someone to a
  contract or communication cannot later deny the authenticity of their signature on a document or in a file or the sending of
  a message that they originated.

  **3. Integrity:** Integrity ensures that the message is real and accurate and safeguards from unauthorized user modification
  during the transmission.

</details>

##### How digital signatures work?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
  **Digital signatures** are created and verified by using public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. By the use
  of a public key algorithm, such as RSA, one can generate two keys that are mathematically linked- one is a private key, and another
  is a public key.
  The user who is creating the digital signature uses their own private key to encrypt the signature-related document. There is only
  one way to decrypt that document with the use of the signer's public key.
  This technology requires all the parties to trust that the individual who creates the signature has been able to keep their private
  key secret. If someone has accessed the signer's private key, there is a possibility that they could create fraudulent signatures in
  the name of the private key holder.

  **The steps which are followed in creating a digital signature are:**

  1. Select a file to be digitally signed.
  2. The hash value of the message or file content is calculated. This message or file content is encrypted by using a private key
  of a sender to form the digital signature.
  3. Now, the original message or file content along with the digital signature is transmitted.
  4. The receiver decrypts the digital signature by using the public key of the sender.
  5. The receiver now has the message or file content and can compute it.
  6. Comparing these computed messages or file content with the original computed message. The comparison needs to be the
  same for ensuring integrity.

</details>



##### What are the types of Digital Signature?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  Different document processing platform supports different types of digital signature.

  **They are described below:**

  **1. Certified Signatures:** The certified digital signature documents display a unique blue ribbon across the top of the
  document. The certified signature contains the name of the document signer and the certificate issuer which indicate the
  authorship and authenticity of the document.

  **2. Approval Signatures:** The approval digital signatures on a document can be used in the organization's business workflow.
  They help to optimize the organization's approval procedure. The procedure involves capturing approvals made by us and
  other individuals and embedding them within the PDF document. The approval signatures to include details such as an
  image of our physical signature, location, date, and official seal.

  **3. Visible Digital Signature:** The visible digital signature allows a user to sign a single document digitally. This signature
  appears on a document in the same way as signatures are signed on a physical document.

  **4. Invisible Digital Signature:** The invisible digital signatures carry a visual indication of a blue ribbon within a document in
  the taskbar. We can use invisible digital signatures when we do not have or do not want to display our signature but need to
  provide the authenticity of the document, its integrity, and its origin.

##### Explain the principles of Cyber Security?

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>

  **Cyber security** for these purposes encompasses the protection of essential information, processes, and systems, connected or
  stored online, with a broad view across the people, technical, and physical domains.

  **The principles of Cyber Security:**

  **1. The economy of mechanism:** This principle states that Security mechanisms should be as simple and small as possible. The
  Economy of mechanism principle simplifies the design and implementation of security mechanisms. If the design and
  implementation are simple and small, fewer possibilities exist for errors. The checking and testing process is less
  complicated so fewer components need to be tested. Interfaces between security modules are the suspect area which
  should be as simple as possible. Because Interface modules often make implicit assumptions about input or output
  parameters or the current system state. If any of these assumptions are wrong, the module's actions may produce
  unexpected results. A simple security framework facilitates its understanding by developers and users and enables the
  efficient development and verification of enforcement methods for it.

  **2. Fail-safe defaults:** The Fail-safe defaults principle states that the default configuration of a system should have a
  conservative protection scheme. This principle also restricts how privileges are initialized when a subject or object is
  created. Whenever access, privileges/rights, or some security-related attribute is not explicitly granted, it should not be
  granted access to that object.

  **3. Example:** If we will add a new user to an operating system, the default group of the user should have fewer access rights to
  files and services.

  **4. Least Privilege:** This principle states that a user should only have those privileges that need to complete his task. Its
  primary function is to control the assignment of rights granted to the user, not the identity of the user. This means that if
  the boss demands root access to a UNIX system that you administer, he/she should not be given that right unless he/she has
  a task that requires a such level of access. If possible, the elevated rights of a user identity should be removed as soon as
  those rights are no longer needed.

  **5. Open Design:** This principle states that the security of a mechanism should not depend on the secrecy of its design or
  implementation. It suggests that complexity does not add security. This principle is the opposite of the approach known as
  "security through obscurity." This principle not only applies to information such as passwords or cryptographic systems but
  also to other computer security-related operations. Example: DVD player & Content Scrambling System (CSS) protection.
  The CSS is a cryptographic algorithm that protects DVD movie disks from unauthorized copying.

  **6. Complete mediation:** The principle of complete mediation restricts the caching of information, which often leads to simpler
  implementations of mechanisms. The idea of this principle is that access to every object must be checked for compliance
  with a protection scheme to ensure that they are allowed. As a consequence, there should be wary of performance
  improvement techniques that save the details of previous authorization checks, since the permissions can change over
  time. Whenever someone tries to access an object, the system should authenticate the access rights associated with that
  subject. The subject's access rights are verified once at the initial access, and for subsequent accesses, the system assumes
  that the same access rights should be accepted for that subject and object. The operating system should mediate all and
  every access to an object. Example: An online banking website should require users to sign in again after a certain period
  like we can say, twenty minutes have elapsed.
